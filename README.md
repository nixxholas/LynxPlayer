A simple yet intuitive music player application.


**This repository is no longer being maintained. Please feel free to use this for learning purposes and submit a pull request if you have a better implementation of the codes that were written. This is one of the first app that I have made for Android. Please bear with the horrible practices.**

This is never intended to be public due to the spaghetti structure of the code. Do create a simplified approach for the queues.
