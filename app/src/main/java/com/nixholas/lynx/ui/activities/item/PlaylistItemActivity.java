 * PlaylistItemActivity

 * Created by nixholas on 8/1/17.
 *
 * This Class will help all of the playlist elements in the playlist fragment
 * to have a expanded view of a playlist. As such, we'll be able to play songs via
 * a specific playlist and this will also mean that there must be a single queue manager
 * for our mediaplayer object.
